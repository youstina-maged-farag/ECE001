            <h2>How AI used in education?</h2>

            <text>AI has already been applied to education primarily in some tools that help develop
                 skills and testing systems. AI can drive efficiency, personalization and streamline admin
                  tasks to allow teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability—uniquely
                   human capabilities where machines would struggle and the bad side of AIin education is 
                 Lack of emotional intelligence is also one of the negative effects of artificial intelligence
                 in education. Artificial intelligence gadgets, devices, and machines have no feelings.
                  In study and learning sometimes students need emotional feelings from their teachers
                   by which they can learn very effectively.

            <h2>How AI is used in medicine?</h2>

            <text>Primary care physicians can use AI to take their notes, analyze their discussions
                 with patients, and enter required information directly into EHR systems. 
                 These applications will collect and analyze patient data and present it to primary care
                  physicians alongside insight into patient's medical needs One example of how AI is
                   improving health care delivery by cutting operating costs is in the field of joint replacement therapy.
                    An intelligent program known as PeerWell helps patients prep for total joint replacement
                     by guiding the course of pre-op physical therapyAI has the ability to analyze big data
                      sets – pulling together patient insights and leading to  predictive analysis.
                       Quickly obtaining patient insights helps the healthcare ecosystem discover key areas of patient care
                        that require improvement. Wearable healthcare technology also uses AI to better serve patients.

            <h2>How is AI used in industry?</h2>

            <text>
                Big data and AI give Industry 4.0 a huge boost.
                 Intelligent software solutions can use the  high volumes of data generated by
                  a factory to identify trends and patterns that can then be used to make manufacturing
                   processes more efficient and reduce their energy consumption.
