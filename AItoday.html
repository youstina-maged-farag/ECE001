            <text>
                Artificial intelligence is widely used to provide personalised recommendations
                 to people, based for example on their previous searches and purchases or other online behaviour.
                  AI is hugely important in commerce: optimising products, planning inventory, logistics etc.

            <h2>Is AI dangerous?</h2>

            <text>
                In 2018, a SurveyMonkey poll of the American public by USA Today found 68% thought the real
                 current threat remains "human intelligence"; however, the poll also found that 43% said
                  superintelligent AI, if it were to happen, would result in "more harm than good", and
                   38% said it would do "equal amounts of harm and good.

            <h2>How artificial intelligence will change the future?</h2>

            <text>
                AI algorithms will enable doctors and hospitals to better analyze data and customize
                 their health care to the genes, environment and lifestyle of each patient.
                  From diagnosing brain tumors to deciding which cancer treatment will work best for an individual,
                   AI will drive the personalized medicine revolution 
            </text>

            <h2>What will AI be able to do in the future?</h2>

            <text>In the AI-enabled future, humans will be able to converse and interact with
                 each other in the native language of choice, not having to worry about miscommunicating
                  intentions. Machine learning models will be able to understand context, nuance, and colloquialisms
                   that help to fill the gaps of human communication
             </text>
